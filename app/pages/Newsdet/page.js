            The meeting aligns with the objectives of establishing the working groups, which include strengthening the
            mutual partnership between the private sector and the government sector, in order to strengthen trade and
            commerce in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The working groups aim to address the private sector’s challenges and
            bring them to the attention of authorities in the UAE and abroad. They also aim to study the private
            sector’s projects, and provide opinions, proposals, and advice to its members and the concerned authorities
            across a range of areas, among other goals, as per Law No. 27 of 2005 concerning the Reorganisation of the
            Abu Dhabi Chamber, and its amendments in Law No. 19 of 2018.<br /><br />The meeting, which was chaired by
            His Excellency Abdulla Mohamed Al Mazrui, Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Chamber, addressed the latest
            developments and achievements, the current challenges across various sectors and ways to overcome them
            effectively, as well as opportunities of collaboration with the concerned parties to find the right
            solutions.<br /><br />His Excellency Al Mazrui said: “Since its establishment, the Abu Dhabi Chamber has
            sought to support Abu Dhabi’s private sector across a range of sectors. The Chamber ensures frequent and
            effective communication with the private sector to drive the sector’s success in a competitive business
            environment. The Chamber also aims to encourage dialogue and consultation with decision-makers to discuss
            developments relevant to the business community. As such, we manage the sectoral working groups as part of
            our role as a policy advocator, to provide the private sector with the opportunity to pass on their views to
            the legislative authorities regarding issues that impact business development and continuity, and contribute
            to the formulation of relevant policies.”<br /><br /><br />His Excellency added: “The Chamber is committed
            to carrying out its tasks and duties to support the private sector in realising its potential. This comes in
            line with the Chamber’s strategic objectives.”<br />The meeting was attended by Karl Magnus Olsson, Board
            Member and Chairman of Transformation Committee at the Abu Dhabi Chamber, and Chairs of the Chamber’s
            working groups, including: Ahmad Rahma Al Masaood, Chairman of the Automotive Agencies and Importers of
            Spare Parts Working Group; Otaiba Saeed Al Otaiba, Chairman of the Working Cities Working Group; Rasheed
            Mikati, Board Member and Chairman of the Construction Working Group; Amer Kakish, Board Member and Chairman
            of the Industry Working Group; Khaled Abdel Karim Al Fahim, Board Member and Chairman of the Healthcare
            Working Group, and Mounir Haidar, Chairman of the Real Estate Working Group.
