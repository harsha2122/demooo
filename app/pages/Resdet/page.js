            <span class="para-1">Science-fiction books and movies feature machines that are smarter than humans. These genius robots and computers are either a blessing or a curse. Artificial intelligence (AI) powers them.<br/>
            AI is part of reality now. It’s already in use in our daily lives. Large businesses are taking advantage of its benefits.
            What about small business? Does it have a role to play in your company? Is AI right for your small business?
            AI and machine learning for small business<br/></span>

            <span class="para-2"><span class='para-res'>What is AI?</span><br/>
            Something has AI when it can process information without an organic brain. It’s not alive, but it can sort information. It can do so as a result of machine learning.<br/>
            What is machine learning?<br/>
            Machine learning is the process of teaching a machine about how to react to some data type. It’s a simple process, but it becomes complex when you add more information.<br/></span>

            <span class="para-3"><span class="para-res">How can I use AI to optimize my small business?</span><br/>
            Imagine you own a florist shop, which also has a website. If a customer searches your site for “red flowers,” you teach your website how to respond. You can train it to show the customer roses, tulips, and Gerbera daisies.</span>
